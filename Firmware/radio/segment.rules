# segment.rules files assign source code modules to specific banks
# These files are only used when we build code with cpu supporting banking
# The final segment.rules file is constructed from any segment.rules found in
# the search path, defined in the CPU Makefile
# When building bankable code, the bank-alloc.py script automatically allocates
# modules to banks. segment.rules files provide hints, instructing the script
# as to which files are safe to move around and which files to leave alone
# In other words, only specify a rule for a file if you need to
# comments starting with "#" are supported
# The file spec in rules is actually interpreted as a python regex so you can
# write a rule that will match multiple files
#
# general rules --
#  SDCC's standard libraries will always go in CSEG - We don't touch them
#  Interrupt code must be in HOME. Specify all files with an ISR here
#  All files without an associated rule get allocated to a bank automatically

# Files with ISRs must be in HOME
